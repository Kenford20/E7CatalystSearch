# Epic7CatalystTool
To solve an issue I often came across while playing the mobile gacha-game, Epic 7, I developed this web application to present lists of data in an organized, table-like format that pertained to a related subsets of other data from the game. For example, if a player needed to find out the materials needed to upgrade their in-game characters, this application allows them to do so in a very simple, easy manner. The application is developed with Angular and Typescript.

## *Search for Catalysts and the Heroes that use them*  
Utilize the search bar to look for a particular catalyst and click to open a table containing lists of heroes along with the number required to upgrade the hero's skills/awakenings, in addition to a list of locations of where to farm this catalyst.

## *Search for Heroes and the catalysts they require*
Click the dropdown to switch to the heroes search. Here you may search for hero names instead and click to open a table containing the 3 catalysts they need to upgrade the hero's skills/awakenings, in addition to lists of locations for each catalyst.
